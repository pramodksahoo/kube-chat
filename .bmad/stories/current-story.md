# Story 1: Project Initialization and Basic Operator Setup

## Story Context
**Epic**: Foundation Infrastructure
**Sprint**: Week 1
**Assignee**: Claude Code Agent (Developer role)
**Status**: In Progress

## User Story
As a platform engineer, I want a basic Kubernetes operator project structure so that I can begin implementing KubeChat functionality on a solid foundation.

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Operator SDK Project Initialization
- Initialize new operator project using Operator SDK
- Configure Go module with proper dependencies
- Set up basic project structure following Kubernetes conventions
- Create initial main.go with operator manager setup

### 2. Basic Configuration
- Configure operator manager with proper settings
- Set up leader election for high availability
- Implement health check endpoints (/healthz, /readyz)
- Add basic logging configuration using logr

### 3. Development Environment
- Create Makefile with common development tasks
- Set up Docker build configuration
- Create basic CI configuration for GitHub Actions
- Add development documentation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Technical Acceptance Criteria:
1. **Operator Initialization**
   - [ ] `operator-sdk init` command executed successfully
   - [ ] Go module properly configured with required dependencies
   - [ ] Project structure follows Kubernetes operator conventions
   - [ ] main.go contains basic operator manager setup

2. **Manager Configuration**
   - [ ] Manager configured with proper metrics binding
   - [ ] Leader election enabled for HA deployment
   - [ ] Health check endpoints exposed and functional
   - [ ] Graceful shutdown handling implemented

3. **Build System**
   - [ ] Makefile includes: build, test, docker-build, deploy targets
   - [ ] Dockerfile creates optimized multi-stage build
   - [ ] GitHub Actions workflow builds and tests code
   - [ ] All builds complete without errors

4. **Documentation**
   - [ ] README.md updated with project description and setup instructions
   - [ ] Development guide created in docs/development/
   - [ ] Architecture decisions documented
   - [ ] Code includes appropriate godoc comments

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Initialize Operator Project
```bash
# Run from project root
operator-sdk init --domain=kubechat.io --repo=github.com/pramodksahoo/kube-chat
```

### Task 2: Configure Dependencies
Add these dependencies to go.mod:
- sigs.k8s.io/controller-runtime
- k8s.io/apimachinery
- k8s.io/client-go
- github.com/go-logr/logr

### Task 3: Implement Manager Setup
Update main.go with:
- Proper manager configuration
- Leader election setup
- Health check endpoints
- Signal handling for graceful shutdown

### Task 4: Create Development Infrastructure
- Makefile with standard targets
- Dockerfile with multi-stage build
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Development documentation

## Technical Context

### Architecture Decisions Made:
1. **Use Operator SDK**: Provides best practices and scaffolding
2. **Leader Election**: Essential for HA operator deployment
3. **Structured Logging**: Using logr for consistent logging
4. **Multi-stage Docker**: Optimize container size and security

### Key Dependencies:
- controller-runtime: Core operator framework
- apimachinery: Kubernetes API machinery
- client-go: Kubernetes API client

### Constraints:
- Must be compatible with Kubernetes 1.29+
- Operator must follow Kubernetes conventions
- Code must be maintainable and well-documented

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests Required:
- Manager initialization and configuration
- Health check endpoint functionality
- Graceful shutdown behavior
- Configuration validation

### Integration Tests Required:
- Operator deployment in test cluster
- Manager startup and leader election
- Health endpoint accessibility

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria completed
- [ ] All tests pass with >80% coverage
- [ ] Code reviewed and documented
- [ ] Operator deploys successfully in test cluster
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow passes
- [ ] Development documentation updated
- [ ] Story marked as complete in tracking system

## Next Story
After completion, move to Story 2: ChatSession CRD Definition and Validation

## Notes for Claude Code Agent
- Focus on getting basic operator working before adding complexity
- Ensure all error cases are handled appropriately
- Follow Go conventions and Kubernetes best practices
- Test everything as you build
- Document architectural decisions in docs/architecture.md
