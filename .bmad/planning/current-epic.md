# Epic: Foundation Infrastructure

## Epic Overview
Establish the basic Kubernetes operator foundation that will serve as the platform for all future KubeChat functionality.

## Epic Goals
1. Create a working Kubernetes operator that can be deployed
2. Define core Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
3. Implement basic controller logic
4. Establish development and testing workflows
5. Create foundation for NLP integration

## Epic Scope
**Included in this Epic:**
- Kubernetes operator skeleton
- ChatSession CRD definition
- Basic controller with reconciliation loop
- RBAC configuration
- Helm chart for deployment
- Unit and integration test framework
- Development documentation

**Not Included (Future Epics):**
- Advanced NLP processing
- Knowledge graph implementation
- Web interface
- CLI tools
- Production optimization

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Operator deploys successfully on any Kubernetes cluster
- [ ] ChatSession resources can be created and managed
- [ ] Controller responds to ChatSession changes
- [ ] All tests pass with >80% coverage
- [ ] Helm chart installs without errors
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate

## Stories in This Epic
1. **Story 1**: Project initialization and basic operator setup
2. **Story 2**: ChatSession CRD definition and validation
3. **Story 3**: Controller implementation with reconciliation logic
4. **Story 4**: RBAC and security configuration
5. **Story 5**: Testing framework and initial tests
6. **Story 6**: Helm chart creation and deployment validation

## Estimated Timeline
4 weeks total (1 story per week, with testing and refinement)

## Dependencies
- None (this is the foundational epic)

## Risk Mitigation
- Start with minimal viable implementation
- Focus on working code over complex features
- Establish testing early to catch issues
- Document all architectural decisions
