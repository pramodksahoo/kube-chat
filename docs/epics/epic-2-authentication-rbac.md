**I want** clear guidance when I don't have sufficient permissions  
**So that** I understand what access I need to complete my tasks

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System SHALL provide specific error messages identifying missing permissions
2. System SHALL suggest the required Kubernetes roles or permissions needed
3. System SHALL indicate which resources or namespaces require additional access
4. System SHALL provide contact information for administrators to request access
5. System SHALL log permission failures for security monitoring
