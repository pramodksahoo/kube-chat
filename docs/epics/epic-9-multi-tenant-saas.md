# Epic 9: Multi-Tenant SaaS Foundation

## Epic Overview

**Epic Goal:** Extend Model 2 architecture with tenant isolation, billing integration, and centralized identity management for SaaS deployment

**Value Proposition:** Enable rapid market expansion through SaaS deployment while maintaining 85% code reuse from Model 2 foundation, providing scalable multi-tenant architecture for global customer acquisition.

## Business Context

This epic enables Phase 3 expansion into the broader SaaS market by transforming the security-first Model 2 (on-premises) foundation into a globally scalable multi-tenant platform. This strategic expansion captures SMBs and scale-ups seeking 60-second onboarding while preserving enterprise-grade capabilities.

## Epic Scope

### Included in This Epic
- Multi-tenant data isolation with row-level security
- Billing integration with usage tracking and subscription management
- Federated SSO management for organizational hierarchies
- Tenant-specific configuration and branding customization
- Cross-organization audit trails and compliance
- API tenant context injection and access controls

### Excluded from This Epic (Future Epics)
- Global edge deployment and performance optimization (Epic 10)
- Customer success tooling and health scoring (Epic 10)
- Advanced usage analytics and ML-based insights (Future)
- Enterprise marketplace integrations (Future)

## Technical Foundation

### Architecture Components
- **Tenant Isolation Service:** Row-level security implementation with PostgreSQL
- **Billing Integration Engine:** Usage tracking with Stripe/Chargebee integration
- **Multi-Org Identity Manager:** Federated SSO with cross-organization provisioning
- **Tenant Configuration Service:** Per-tenant customization and feature gating
- **Usage Analytics Collector:** Real-time usage metrics and cost optimization

### Technology Stack
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security (RLS)
- **Billing:** Stripe/Chargebee integration with webhook processing
- **Identity:** Extends Epic 2 OIDC/SAML with multi-org federation
- **Monitoring:** Per-tenant metrics isolation and aggregation
- **API Gateway:** Tenant context injection middleware

## User Stories

### Story 9.1: Multi-Tenant Data Isolation
**As a** platform administrator  
**I want** multi-tenant data isolation  
**So that** customer data remains completely segregated in the SaaS environment

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System SHALL implement row-level security (RLS) for all tenant data in PostgreSQL
2. System SHALL provide tenant-aware APIs with automatic tenant context injection
3. System SHALL prevent cross-tenant data access through comprehensive access controls
4. System SHALL support tenant-specific configuration and branding customization

**Story Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Story Points:** 13
**Dependencies:** Epic 2 (Authentication), Epic 3 (Audit Logging)

### Story 9.2: Integrated Billing and Usage Tracking
**As a** customer success manager  
**I want** integrated billing and usage tracking  
**So that** I can manage subscription lifecycles and usage-based pricing

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System SHALL track user actions, commands executed, and resource consumption per tenant
2. System SHALL integrate with billing providers (Stripe, Chargebee) for automated invoicing
3. System SHALL provide usage analytics and cost optimization recommendations
4. System SHALL support multiple pricing tiers with feature gating and usage limits

**Story Priority:** P0 (Critical)
**Story Points:** 21
**Dependencies:** Story 9.1, Epic 3 (Audit data for usage tracking)

### Story 9.3: Federated SSO Management
**As an** enterprise customer  
**I want** federated SSO management  
**So that** I can manage user access across multiple organizations from a central identity hub

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System SHALL support organization-level OIDC/SAML configuration management
2. System SHALL provide cross-organization user provisioning and deprovisioning
3. System SHALL maintain audit trails across organizational boundaries
4. System SHALL support just-in-time (JIT) user provisioning from enterprise directories

**Story Priority:** P1 (High)
**Story Points:** 13
**Dependencies:** Epic 2 (Authentication foundation), Story 9.1

## Success Criteria

### Functional Success Criteria
- [ ] Complete tenant data isolation with zero cross-tenant data leakage
- [ ] Automated billing integration with accurate usage tracking
- [ ] Federated SSO supporting enterprise organizational hierarchies
- [ ] Tenant-specific configuration and branding capabilities
- [ ] Cross-organization audit compliance and reporting

### Technical Success Criteria
- [ ] Multi-tenant API performance <200ms for 95th percentile
- [ ] Billing accuracy >99.9% with automated reconciliation
- [ ] Support for 1000+ concurrent tenants per deployment
- [ ] Zero-downtime tenant onboarding and configuration
- [ ] Database query performance maintained with RLS overhead <10%

### Business Success Criteria
- [ ] 85% code reuse from Model 2 foundation achieved
- [ ] Customer onboarding time <60 seconds from signup to first command
- [ ] Support for multiple pricing tiers with feature differentiation
- [ ] Automated trial-to-paid conversion workflows
- [ ] Enterprise-grade audit compliance in multi-tenant environment

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation

### High Risks
1. **Multi-Tenant Security Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Comprehensive RLS testing, security audits, penetration testing
   - **Contingency:** Per-tenant database schemas if RLS proves insufficient

2. **Billing Integration Accuracy**
   - **Mitigation:** Extensive usage tracking validation, automated reconciliation
   - **Contingency:** Manual billing processes with automated correction tools

### Medium Risks
1. **Performance Impact of RLS**
   - **Mitigation:** Database optimization, query performance monitoring
   - **Contingency:** Hybrid architecture with tenant-specific optimizations

2. **Cross-Organization Identity Complexity**
   - **Mitigation:** Phased rollout, extensive integration testing
   - **Contingency:** Simplified single-organization model initially
