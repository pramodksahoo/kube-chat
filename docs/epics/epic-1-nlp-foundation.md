**Story Points:** 5
**Dependencies:** Story 1.1, 1.2

### Story 1.4: Conversational Context Support
**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want** to maintain conversational context for follow-up commands  
**So that** I can have natural conversations about my cluster state

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System SHALL maintain context of previous commands and responses within a session
2. System SHALL understand follow-up questions like "describe the first one" or "delete that pod"
3. System SHALL reference previous command outputs for context-aware responses
4. System SHALL handle context expiration and session management
5. System SHALL provide clear indication when context is lost or unavailable

**Story Priority:** P1 (High)
**Story Points:** 8
**Dependencies:** Story 1.1, 1.3

### Story 1.5: Basic Error Handling and Recovery
**As a** DevOps engineer  
**I want** helpful error messages and recovery suggestions  
**So that** I can understand and fix issues with my commands

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. System SHALL provide clear error messages for malformed natural language requests
2. System SHALL suggest corrections for common command interpretation errors
3. System SHALL handle kubectl command failures with explanation and next steps
4. System SHALL gracefully handle temporary Kubernetes API unavailability
5. System SHALL maintain system stability during error conditions
