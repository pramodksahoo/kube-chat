# Product Requirements Document: KubeChat

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals
- Enable DevOps engineers to manage Kubernetes clusters through natural language commands while maintaining enterprise-grade security and compliance
- Reduce kubectl syntax troubleshooting time by 60% for DevOps engineers (from 30-40% to 12-16% of daily tasks)
- Provide comprehensive audit trails for 100% of Kubernetes operations to meet regulatory requirements (SOC 2, HIPAA, FedRAMP)
- Establish KubeChat as the compliance-first natural language Kubernetes management platform for regulated industries
- Achieve first paid enterprise customer within 6 months through premium positioning in financial services, healthcare, and government sectors

### Background Context

KubeChat addresses the critical intersection of Kubernetes operational complexity and regulatory compliance requirements in enterprise environments. Current kubectl management creates productivity bottlenecks for DevOps engineers while failing to provide the comprehensive audit trails, access controls, and data protection measures that regulated industries require. 

This PRD defines the technical requirements to deliver a Kubernetes operator that translates natural language commands into secure, auditable kubectl operations while enforcing organizational policies and regulatory frameworks. The solution targets the $2M+ market opportunity in compliance-sensitive Kubernetes management where existing tools force organizations to choose between operational efficiency and regulatory adherence.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
KubeChat provides a familiar chat-based interface that feels as intuitive as consumer messaging applications while maintaining the precision and safety controls required for enterprise Kubernetes management. The interface balances conversational ease-of-use with clear visibility into system actions, permissions, and audit trails.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Conversational Command Input:** Users interact through natural language messages with intelligent auto-completion and command suggestions
- **Confirmation-Based Safety:** All destructive or write operations require explicit user confirmation with clear preview of intended actions
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Advanced features (audit logs, compliance reports, user management) accessible through contextual menus without cluttering the primary chat interface
- **Real-time Feedback:** Immediate visual indicators for command processing status, permission validation, and execution results

### Core Screens and Views
- **Primary Chat Interface:** Central conversation view with message history, command input, and real-time status indicators
- **Command Preview Modal:** Detailed preview of kubectl commands generated from natural language with approval/cancel options
- **Audit Dashboard:** Comprehensive view of user activity, compliance metrics, and audit trail exports
- **Admin Configuration:** System settings for RBAC integration, command policies, and compliance reporting parameters

### Accessibility Requirements
**WCAG AA** - KubeChat will meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 Level AA standards to ensure usability for DevOps engineers with disabilities, including keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and sufficient color contrast ratios.

### Branding Guidelines
Enterprise-focused design with trust and security as primary brand attributes. Clean, professional interface design that conveys reliability and precision. Color scheme emphasizes safety (green for safe operations, amber for caution, red for destructive actions) with consistent iconography for different command types.

### Target Platforms
**Web** - Browser-based application accessible across desktop and tablet devices with responsive design optimized for professional development environments.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure
**Monorepo** - Single repository containing operator (Go), web interface (React), documentation, and deployment manifests. This structure facilitates coordinated development, simplified CI/CD pipelines, and atomic releases while maintaining clear module boundaries for different technical domains.

### Service Architecture
**Microservices** - Kubernetes operator core with separate services for natural language processing, audit logging, compliance reporting, and web interface. This architecture supports independent scaling of compute-intensive NLP operations while maintaining strong security boundaries for compliance data.

### Testing Requirements
**Full pyramid** - Comprehensive testing strategy including unit tests (80%+ coverage), integration tests for API endpoints and Kubernetes interactions, and end-to-end tests for critical user workflows. Automated testing pipeline includes security scanning, compliance validation, and performance benchmarking.

### Additional Technical Assumptions
- **OpenAI API Integration:** Reliable access to OpenAI GPT-4 API with acceptable latency (<500ms) and cost structure for enterprise deployments
- **Kubernetes Version Support:** Target Kubernetes 1.24+ with backwards compatibility for 1.22+ to support enterprise adoption timelines
- **Database Technology:** PostgreSQL for audit data persistence with encryption at rest and automated backup/retention policies
- **Container Registry:** Support for enterprise container registries with image scanning and security validation requirements
- **Secrets Management:** Integration with HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Kubernetes native secrets with rotation capabilities
- **Network Security:** Assume enterprise network policies requiring mutual TLS for all service-to-service communication
- **Identity Provider Integration:** Standard OIDC/SAML compatibility with major enterprise identity systems (Active Directory, Okta, Auth0)
- **Compliance Data Residency:** Configurable data storage location to meet geographic compliance requirements (EU GDPR, data sovereignty)
- **High Availability:** Multi-zone deployment capability with automated failover for production enterprise environments
- **Monitoring Integration:** Prometheus metrics and structured logging compatible with enterprise observability stacks
