# Product Requirements Document: KubeChat

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

**Primary Goals (Model 2 - On-Premises):**
- Enable DevOps engineers to manage Kubernetes clusters through natural language commands while maintaining enterprise-grade security and complete data sovereignty
- Reduce kubectl syntax troubleshooting time by 60% for DevOps engineers (from 30-40% to 12-16% of daily tasks)
- Provide comprehensive audit trails for 100% of Kubernetes operations to meet regulatory requirements (SOC 2, HIPAA, FedRAMP)
- Establish KubeChat as the security-first, zero vendor lock-in Kubernetes management platform for regulated industries
- Achieve first paid enterprise customer within 6 months through premium positioning in financial services, healthcare, and government sectors

**Expansion Goals (Model 1 - SaaS):**
- Capture broader market segments (SMBs, scale-ups) with 60-second onboarding and managed service experience  
- Scale to 1000+ organizations through product-led growth and viral adoption patterns
- Generate recurring subscription revenue ($50-500/user/month) complementing enterprise licensing model
- Provide global performance with <200ms response times through edge deployment infrastructure
- Enable seamless migration paths between deployment models to preserve customer choice and maximize market reach

### Background Context

KubeChat addresses the critical intersection of Kubernetes operational complexity and regulatory compliance requirements across diverse enterprise environments. Current kubectl management creates productivity bottlenecks for DevOps engineers while failing to provide the comprehensive audit trails, access controls, and data sovereignty that modern organizations require.

This PRD defines a dual-deployment strategy to maximize market reach:

**Model 2 (On-Premises)** targets security-conscious enterprises requiring complete data sovereignty, air-gap capability, and zero vendor lock-in through Helm-native deployment directly into customer Kubernetes clusters. This approach captures the $2M+ market opportunity in compliance-sensitive industries where data residency and infrastructure control are non-negotiable.

**Model 1 (SaaS)** expands market reach to growth-stage organizations seeking rapid time-to-value through managed service deployment with 60-second onboarding. This model leverages 85% code reuse from the on-premises foundation while adding multi-tenancy, billing integration, and global edge performance.

The solution eliminates the false choice between operational efficiency and regulatory compliance by providing enterprise-grade natural language Kubernetes management with deployment flexibility that matches organizational requirements rather than forcing architectural compromises.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision
KubeChat provides a familiar chat-based interface that feels as intuitive as consumer messaging applications while maintaining the precision and safety controls required for enterprise Kubernetes management. The interface balances conversational ease-of-use with clear visibility into system actions, permissions, and audit trails.

### Key Interaction Paradigms
- **Conversational Command Input:** Users interact through natural language messages with intelligent auto-completion and command suggestions
- **Confirmation-Based Safety:** All destructive or write operations require explicit user confirmation with clear preview of intended actions
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Advanced features (audit logs, compliance reports, user management) accessible through contextual menus without cluttering the primary chat interface
- **Real-time Feedback:** Immediate visual indicators for command processing status, permission validation, and execution results

### Core Screens and Views
- **Primary Chat Interface:** Central conversation view with message history, command input, and real-time status indicators
- **Command Preview Modal:** Detailed preview of kubectl commands generated from natural language with approval/cancel options
- **Audit Dashboard:** Comprehensive view of user activity, compliance metrics, and audit trail exports
- **Admin Configuration:** System settings for RBAC integration, command policies, and compliance reporting parameters

### Accessibility Requirements
**WCAG AA** - KubeChat will meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 Level AA standards to ensure usability for DevOps engineers with disabilities, including keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and sufficient color contrast ratios.

### Branding Guidelines
Enterprise-focused design with trust and security as primary brand attributes. Clean, professional interface design that conveys reliability and precision. Color scheme emphasizes safety (green for safe operations, amber for caution, red for destructive actions) with consistent iconography for different command types.

### Target Platforms
**Web** - Browser-based application accessible across desktop and tablet devices with responsive design optimized for professional development environments.

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure
**Monorepo** - Single repository containing operator (Go), web interface (React), documentation, and deployment manifests. This structure facilitates coordinated development, simplified CI/CD pipelines, and atomic releases while maintaining clear module boundaries for different technical domains.

### Service Architecture
**Microservices** - Kubernetes operator core with separate services for natural language processing, audit logging, compliance reporting, and web interface. This architecture supports independent scaling of compute-intensive NLP operations while maintaining strong security boundaries for compliance data. The microservices design enables 85% code reuse between on-premises (Model 2) and SaaS (Model 1) deployment models through tenant isolation patterns.

### Testing Requirements
**Full pyramid** - Comprehensive testing strategy including unit tests (80%+ coverage), integration tests for API endpoints and Kubernetes interactions, and end-to-end tests for critical user workflows. Automated testing pipeline includes security scanning, compliance validation, and performance benchmarking.

### Additional Technical Assumptions

**Model 2 (On-Premises) - Primary Development Target:**
- **Helm-Native Deployment:** Complete customer environment integration via Helm charts with zero external dependencies
- **Air-Gap Capability:** Optional offline installation with bundled container images and documentation
- **Customer Infrastructure:** Target Kubernetes 1.24+ with backwards compatibility for 1.22+ to support enterprise adoption timelines
