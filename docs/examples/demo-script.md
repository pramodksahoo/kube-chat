- Parameter extraction (name: nginx, replicas: 3)
- Generated kubectl command
- Safety assessment (üü¢ SAFE)

```
Step 2 - Create Service:
Command: "Create a service for nginx on port 80"
```

**Show Service Creation**:
- Intent: CREATE_SERVICE
- Parameters: target=nginx, port=80
- Service type selection (ClusterIP default)

```
Step 3 - Scale Operation:
Command: "Scale nginx to 5 replicas"
```

**Demonstrate Confirmation**:
- Safety assessment (üü° CAUTION)
- Confirmation dialog appears
- Impact explanation
- Click "Confirm" to proceed

**Key Points to Highlight**:
- Intelligent parameter extraction
- Automatic kubectl command generation
- Safety assessments prevent accidents
- Real-time progress updates

### Part 3: Resource Dashboard Deep Dive (4 minutes)

**Goal**: Show visual resource management capabilities

**Script**:
```
"Let's explore the Resource Dashboard - click the üìä button"
```

**Dashboard Tour**:

1. **Statistics Overview**:
   ```
   Point out:
   - Total resources managed: 5
   - Created: 2, Updated: 1, Deleted: 0
   - Resource types: 3 (Deployment, Service, Pod)
   ```

2. **Resource Cards**:
   ```
   Show features:
   - Resource icons (üöÄ for deployments, üåê for services)
   - Action badges (created, updated, deleted)
   - Timestamps ("2 minutes ago")
   - Resource details (namespace, kind, action)
   ```

3. **Filtering**:
   ```
   Demonstrate:
   - Click "üöÄ Deployment (1)" - shows only deployments
   - Click "üåê Service (1)" - shows only services  
   - Click "All (5)" - shows everything
   ```

4. **Real-time Updates**:
   ```
   Go back to chat and run:
   "Update nginx image to nginx:1.20"
   
   Show confirmation dialog ‚Üí Confirm ‚Üí Watch dashboard update:
   - nginx-deployment card changes to "updated" badge
   - Timestamp updates to "Just now"
   - Statistics increment updated count
   ```

**Key Points to Highlight**:
- Visual resource overview
- Real-time synchronization
- Filtering and organization
- Historical tracking of all operations

### Part 4: Safety & Confirmation System (3 minutes)

**Goal**: Demonstrate safety features preventing accidental damage

**Script**:
```
"KubeChat includes comprehensive safety features. Let's see them in action."

Example 1 - Safe Operation (No Confirmation):
Command: "List all services"
Result: Executes immediately (üü¢ SAFE)

Example 2 - Caution Operation (Confirmation Recommended):
Command: "Scale nginx to 10 replicas"
```

**Show Caution Dialog**:
- Safety level: üü° CAUTION
- Impact assessment: "Will create 5 additional pods"
- Resource requirements estimation
- Recommendations checklist

```
Example 3 - Dangerous Operation (Confirmation Required):
Command: "Restart nginx deployment"
```

**Show Dangerous Dialog**:
- Safety level: üü† DANGEROUS  
- Impact: "All pods will be recreated"
- Service disruption warning
- Best practices recommendations

```
Example 4 - Destructive Operation (Strong Confirmation):
Command: "Delete nginx deployment"
```

**Show Destructive Dialog**:
- Safety level: üî¥ DESTRUCTIVE
- Impact: "All 5 pods will be terminated permanently"
- Recovery difficulty: "Cannot be easily restored"
- Safety checklist with checkboxes
- Strong confirmation button

**Key Points to Highlight**:
- Four-tier safety system
- Context-aware risk assessment
- Educational confirmations
- Prevents accidental data loss
