# KubeChat UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for KubeChat's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas
- **Enterprise DevOps Engineer:** Technical professionals managing production Kubernetes clusters in regulated environments who need both operational efficiency and comprehensive audit trails
- **Compliance-Conscious Administrator:** Security-focused team leads who require visibility, control, and evidence generation for regulatory compliance
- **Junior Engineer:** Less experienced team members who need safety guardrails and clear guidance to perform cluster operations confidently

#### Usability Goals
- **Safety First:** Zero tolerance for accidental destructive operations - all write actions require explicit confirmation with clear risk indicators
- **Enterprise Trust:** Professional, reliable interface that conveys security and precision appropriate for production environments
- **Conversational Ease:** Natural language interaction feels as intuitive as consumer messaging while maintaining enterprise standards
- **Compliance Transparency:** Audit trails and evidence generation are visible and accessible throughout the user experience
- **Accessibility Compliance:** WCAG AA conformance ensures usability for all team members regardless of abilities

#### Design Principles
1. **Clarity over Cleverness** - Every interface element serves a clear purpose with no ambiguous interactions
2. **Safety Through Confirmation** - Destructive operations require explicit user confirmation with visual risk indicators  
3. **Progressive Trust** - Build user confidence through consistent feedback and transparent system behavior
4. **Regulatory Readiness** - Design compliance capabilities as first-class features, not afterthoughts
5. **Professional Accessibility** - Ensure all functionality works seamlessly with assistive technologies and enterprise accessibility requirements

    B --> C[Command Confirmation Dialog]
    B --> D[Audit Dashboard]
    B --> E[User Settings]
    D --> D1[Activity Log Search]
    D --> D2[Compliance Reports]
    D --> D3[Export Audit Data]
    E --> E1[Profile Settings]
    E --> E2[Command Preferences]
    E --> E3[Notification Settings]
    B --> F[Admin Panel]

    F --> F2[Policy Configuration]
    F --> F3[System Health]
    C --> C1[Command Preview]
    C --> C2[Risk Assessment]
    C --> C3[RBAC Validation]
```

### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation:** Single-screen chat interface with contextual panels that slide in from the right side. Primary actions (chat, audit, settings) accessible via icon buttons in the left sidebar, maintaining focus on the conversational experience.

**Secondary Navigation:** Context-sensitive menus within each major section. Command confirmation dialogs overlay the main interface. Audit dashboard and settings open as slide-out panels to preserve chat context.

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** Minimal breadcrumbs only within admin sections and deep audit searches. Primary chat interface maintains conversational flow without traditional navigation patterns.

## User Flows

### Natural Language Command Execution Flow

**User Goal:** Execute Kubernetes operations through natural language without memorizing kubectl syntax

**Entry Points:** Main chat interface message input field, voice input (future), quick action buttons

**Success Criteria:** Command is successfully translated, validated against RBAC, executed, and results displayed with full audit trail

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User types natural language request] --> B{Command type analysis}
    B -->|Read operation| C[Generate kubectl command]
    B -->|Write operation| D[Generate command + trigger confirmation]
    C --> E[Validate RBAC permissions]
    D --> F[Show confirmation dialog]
    F -->|Approved| E
    F -->|Cancelled| G[Return to chat]
    E -->|Authorized| H[Execute command]
    E -->|Denied| I[Show permission error]
    H --> J[Display results]
    I --> G
    J --> K[Log to audit trail]
    K --> G
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- **Ambiguous natural language**: System requests clarification with suggested interpretations
- **Network connectivity issues**: Graceful degradation with clear error messages and retry options
- **RBAC permission denied**: Clear explanation of required permissions with request escalation option
- **Command execution failures**: Detailed kubectl error interpretation with suggested remediation steps
- **Session timeout during execution**: Automatic re-authentication prompt with command state preservation

**Notes:** This flow emphasizes safety through confirmation and transparency through clear feedback at each step.

### Command Safety Confirmation Flow

**User Goal:** Understand the exact impact of write operations before execution to prevent accidental cluster modifications

**Entry Points:** Any natural language request that translates to write/destructive kubectl operations

**Success Criteria:** User clearly understands the operation impact and makes informed decision to proceed or cancel

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Destructive command detected] --> B[Analyze command impact]
    B --> C[Show confirmation modal]
    C --> D[Display exact kubectl command]
    D --> E[Show affected resources]
    E --> F[Highlight risk level]
    F --> G{User decision}
    G -->|Approve| H[Execute with full audit]
    G -->|Cancel| I[Return to chat]
    G -->|Modify| J[Return to input with suggestions]
    H --> K[Show execution results]
    I --> L[Log cancellation]
    J --> M[Pre-fill input field]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- **Complex multi-resource operations**: Break down impact into clear resource-by-resource explanations
- **Cascading delete operations**: Warn about dependent resources that will be affected
- **Irreversible operations**: Extra confirmation step with typed confirmation phrase
- **Production environment detection**: Enhanced warnings and additional approval requirements
- **Insufficient preview information**: Fall back to command preview with risk level indicators

**Notes:** This flow implements the safety-first principle with progressive disclosure of risk information.

### Compliance Audit Access Flow

**User Goal:** Access audit trails and compliance evidence for regulatory requirements and incident investigation

**Entry Points:** Audit dashboard icon, compliance reports menu, incident investigation links

**Success Criteria:** User finds relevant audit information and can export evidence in required format

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Access audit dashboard] --> B[Load recent activity]
    B --> C{Search type}
    C -->|Browse recent| D[Show chronological list]
    C -->|Specific search| E[Show search filters]
    C -->|Compliance report| F[Show report templates]
    D --> G[Select activity item]
    E --> H[Execute filtered search]
    F --> I[Generate compliance report]
    G --> J[Show detailed audit record]
    H --> G
    I --> K[Preview/Download report]
    J --> L[Export audit evidence]
    K --> M[Compliance handoff]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- **Large result sets**: Pagination with performance optimization and progressive loading
- **Missing audit data**: Clear indicators of data retention limits with escalation paths
- **Export format requirements**: Multiple export options (PDF, CSV, JSON) with format validation
- **Access permission issues**: Clear separation between user audit data and admin-level compliance reports
- **Concurrent user sessions**: Real-time updates to audit logs with conflict resolution

**Notes:** This flow treats compliance as a first-class citizen with professional tooling for regulatory evidence.

- **Info (Blue):** System messages, informational content, neutral states

**States:** Normal, hover, active, disabled, loading

**Usage Guidelines:** Always pair color indicators with text labels and icons for accessibility. Use consistent placement (left border, background tint, or icon) across all components.

### Command Message Bubble

**Purpose:** Display natural language requests and system responses in conversational format

**Variants:**
- **User Message:** Right-aligned, blue background, rounded corners
- **System Response:** Left-aligned, gray background, includes safety indicator
