**Dependencies:** All complete (Stories 2.1, 2.1.2, 2.3)

## Story
**As a** security administrator,  
**I want** to enforce multi-factor authentication for KubeChat access,  
**so that** we meet enterprise security policies for production system access

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System SHALL enforce MFA when required by enterprise identity provider
2. System SHALL support common MFA methods (TOTP, SMS, push notifications, hardware tokens)
3. System SHALL handle MFA challenges gracefully with clear user guidance
4. System SHALL respect MFA policies configured in enterprise identity systems
5. System SHALL maintain MFA status throughout session lifecycle

## Dev Notes
**Priority:** P1 (High) - Required for enterprise security compliance
**Story Points:** 5
**Dependencies:**
- Story 2.1 (OIDC Integration) - Complete. OIDC middleware in `pkg/middleware/auth.go` provides identity provider foundation with MFA capability detection
- Story 2.1.2 (JWT RBAC Claims) - Required for MFA state tracking in enhanced JWT claims
- Story 2.3 (Session Management) - Complete for MFA session lifecycle management via `pkg/middleware/jwt.go#JWTService`

**Security Impact:** HIGH - Significantly reduces authentication attack surface

**MFA Integration Context (from Story 2.1):**
```go
// Existing OIDC middleware provides MFA foundation
// pkg/middleware/auth.go#OIDCMiddleware handles provider MFA flows
// pkg/middleware/saml.go#SAMLProvider supports MFA assertions
```

**JWT Claims for MFA State (Story 2.1.2 integration):**
```go
type JWTClaims struct {
    MFACompleted        bool      `json:"mfa_completed"`         // MFA validation status
    MFAMethod          string    `json:"mfa_method,omitempty"`  // TOTP, SMS, Push, etc.
    MFATimestamp       time.Time `json:"mfa_timestamp"`         // When MFA was completed
    MFAValidityDuration time.Duration `json:"mfa_validity"`      // How long MFA is valid
    RequiresMFAStepUp  bool      `json:"requires_mfa_stepup"`   // High-risk operation flag
}
```

**Integration Points:**
- OIDC MFA flow handling via existing `pkg/middleware/auth.go#HandleOIDCCallback()`
- SAML MFA assertion processing via `pkg/middleware/saml.go#ProcessAssertion()`
- MFA state persistence using Story 2.3 session management patterns

**Technical Notes:**
- Builds on existing OIDC/SAML infrastructure from Story 2.1 with minimal code changes
- Must respect MFA policies configured in external identity providers via existing provider integration
- Session state management critical for MFA status tracking, leveraging Story 2.3 session lifecycle
- Performance impact must be minimal for non-MFA users through efficient claims caching

**Definition of Ready:**
- [ ] MFA requirements validated with enterprise identity providers
- [ ] Supported MFA methods confirmed with stakeholders
- [ ] Integration approach with existing authentication confirmed
- [ ] Emergency access procedures defined
