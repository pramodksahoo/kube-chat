### WebSocket Integration
[Source: docs/architecture.md#api-specification]

**Resource Update Events:**
- Connection: `wss://api.kubechat.dev/resources/{sessionId}?token={jwt}`
- Events: `resource_updated`, `resource_created`, `resource_deleted`, `cluster_state_changed`

### File Locations and Structure
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

**Component Files:**
- Dashboard components: `web/src/components/dashboard/`
- Kubernetes-specific components: `web/src/components/kubernetes/`
- Custom hooks: `web/src/hooks/useKubernetesResources.ts`
- State management: `web/src/stores/resourceStore.ts`
- API clients: `web/src/services/kubernetesApi.ts`

**Test Files:**
- Component tests: `web/src/components/**/*.test.tsx`
- Hook tests: `web/src/hooks/**/*.test.ts`
- Integration tests: `web/src/__tests__/integration/dashboard.test.tsx`

### Coding Standards and Patterns
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

**React Component Standards:**
- Use functional components only with TypeScript interfaces
- Implement proper error boundaries for dashboard components
- Follow accessibility standards (WCAG AA) with aria-labels and keyboard navigation
- Use useCallback and useMemo for performance optimization
- Implement proper loading and error states

**State Management:**
- Use Zustand for resource dashboard state
- Implement optimistic updates for real-time feedback
- Cache resource data efficiently with TTL policies

**Testing Requirements:**
- Use Vitest + Testing Library for component testing
- Implement accessibility testing with automated a11y checks
- Create integration tests for dashboard interactions
- Add performance testing for large resource sets

### API Integration
[Source: docs/architecture.md#api-specification]

**REST Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/resources` - List cluster resources [Source: docs/architecture.md#paths-resources]
- `GET /api/v1/resources/{kind}/{name}` - Get specific resource details
- `GET /api/v1/resources/{kind}/{name}/describe` - Get resource description
- `GET /api/v1/resources/{kind}/{name}/logs` - Stream resource logs  
- `GET /api/v1/resources/{kind}/{name}/events` - Get resource events

**Resource Monitoring WebSocket:**
[Source: docs/architecture.md#websocket-events]
- Connection: `wss://api.kubechat.dev/resources/{sessionId}?token={jwt}`
- Events: `resource_updated`, `resource_created`, `resource_deleted`, `cluster_state_changed`
- Implement reconnection logic for network failures
- Handle resource permission errors gracefully

### Performance Considerations
- Implement virtual scrolling for large resource lists
- Use React.memo for resource card components
- Implement debounced search and filtering
- Cache resource relationship graphs
- Use lazy loading for detailed resource information

### Accessibility Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#accessibility_review]
- WCAG AA compliance for all dashboard components
- Keyboard navigation support for all interactive elements
- Screen reader compatibility with proper ARIA attributes
- Sufficient color contrast for resource status indicators
- Focus management for modal dialogs and complex interactions

### RBAC Integration Requirements
[Source: docs/stories/2.2.kubernetes-rbac-permission-enforcement.story.md]

**Permission Enforcement Pattern:**
- Use existing `pkg/middleware/rbac_validator.go` for permission checking
- Integrate with Kubernetes SubjectAccessReview API for resource-level validation
- Implement namespace-scoped resource filtering based on user's RBAC roles
- Handle permission errors with existing error response patterns from Story 2.2

**Implementation Details:**
```typescript
interface ResourcePermission {
  canView: boolean;
  canDescribe: boolean;
  canViewLogs: boolean;
  canViewEvents: boolean;
  namespace: string;
  resource: string;
}

// Permission checking service integration
const checkResourcePermission = async (resource: KubernetesResource): Promise<ResourcePermission> => {
  // Integrate with existing RBAC validator
  // Return permission matrix for resource actions
};
```

**Permission Error Handling:**
- Follow established patterns from `pkg/models/rbac_error.go`
- Display clear error messages for unauthorized resource access
- Suggest required RBAC roles and permissions in error responses
- Integrate with Epic 1 error handling patterns

### Audit Logging Integration Requirements  
[Source: docs/stories/3.1.comprehensive-user-activity-logging.story.md]

**Audit Event Requirements:**
- Use existing `cmd/audit-service` for comprehensive event logging
- Integrate with tamper-proof storage infrastructure from Epic 3
- Follow established audit event structure and types from `pkg/models/audit_event.go`
- Ensure 100% audit coverage for resource dashboard interactions

**Audit Event Types for Dashboard:**
```typescript
enum DashboardAuditEventType {
  RESOURCE_VIEW = 'resource_view',
  RESOURCE_DESCRIBE = 'resource_describe', 
  RESOURCE_LOGS_ACCESS = 'resource_logs_access',
  RESOURCE_EVENTS_ACCESS = 'resource_events_access',
  RESOURCE_FILTER = 'resource_filter',
  DASHBOARD_ACCESS = 'dashboard_access'
}

interface ResourceAuditEvent {
  eventType: DashboardAuditEventType;
  resourceKind: string;
  resourceName: string;
  namespace?: string;
  userId: string;
  sessionId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  success: boolean;
  metadata: {
    permissionLevel: string;
    filterCriteria?: string;
    viewDuration?: number;
  };
}
```

**Integration with Existing Audit Infrastructure:**
- Use async event processing with NATS JetStream for reliability
- Implement event buffering and retry logic for system failure scenarios
- Integration with PostgreSQL tamper-proof storage with SHA-256 checksums
- Follow configurable retention policies (minimum 7 years compliance)

### Command History Integration Requirements
[Source: Epic 1 Command Execution + Epic 4 Chat Interface]

**Command-Resource Correlation:**
- Map executed commands to affected Kubernetes resources
- Display command execution context in resource status indicators  
- Show which user commands caused current resource states
- Link resource dashboard to chat session command history

**Implementation Pattern:**
```typescript
interface CommandResourceImpact {
  commandId: string;
  sessionId: string; 
  naturalLanguageInput: string;
  executedCommand: string;
  affectedResources: KubernetesResource[];
  executionTimestamp: Date;
  beforeState?: ResourceStatus;
  afterState?: ResourceStatus;
}

// Integration with existing command execution history
const getResourceCommandHistory = (resource: KubernetesResource): CommandResourceImpact[] => {
  // Query command history that affected this resource
  // Return chronological list of command impacts
};
```

**Resource Change Attribution:**
- Track resource state changes to specific user commands
- Display "Last modified by command" in resource details
- Show command execution timeline for resource changes
- Enable filtering resources by commands that affected them

**Integration with Chat Session History:**
- Link resource dashboard to existing chat interface from Stories 4.1-4.3
- Use established WebSocket communication patterns
- Access command execution results from existing session management
- Follow existing state management patterns with Zustand
