## Dev Agent Record

**Agent Model Used:** James (Full Stack Developer) - claude-sonnet-4-20250514  
**Development Started:** 2025-09-04  
**Epic Context:** Story 3.3 - Comprehensive audit trail search and investigation capabilities

### Development Approach
This implementation builds upon the established audit infrastructure from Stories 3.1 and 3.2, adding comprehensive search, traceability, and compliance reporting capabilities. The approach follows a layered architecture:

1. **Core Search Engine** (`pkg/audit/search.go`) - PostgreSQL FTS-based audit search with advanced filtering
2. **Traceability Engine** (`pkg/audit/traceability.go`) - Command correlation from natural language to cluster impact  
3. **Compliance Reporting** (`pkg/audit/reports.go`) - Automated regulatory compliance report generation
4. **Investigation Tools** (`pkg/audit/investigation.go`) - Security forensic analysis and anomaly detection
5. **API Layer** - REST endpoints integrated into existing audit-service architecture

### Architectural Decisions
- **PostgreSQL FTS**: Leveraging built-in full-text search for high-performance audit log searching without external dependencies
- **RBAC Integration**: All search operations respect user's Kubernetes RBAC scope from Epic 2 authentication
