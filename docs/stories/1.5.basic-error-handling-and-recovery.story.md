## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
[From Story 1.4 Dev Agent Record]
- Context management system now fully operational with session tracking
- SessionContext and entity extraction working with comprehensive reference resolution
- API endpoints established with proper validation and error responses
- Thread-safe concurrent access patterns implemented

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture.md#data-models]

**Existing Error Infrastructure:**
The codebase already includes a sophisticated error handling foundation:
```go
// KubectlError represents a structured kubectl error
type KubectlError struct {
    Type        ErrorType `json:"type"`
    Code        string    `json:"code"`
    Message     string    `json:"message"`
    Suggestion  string    `json:"suggestion"`
    Resource    string    `json:"resource,omitempty"`
    Namespace   string    `json:"namespace,omitempty"`
    Recoverable bool      `json:"recoverable"`
}
```

**Error Types Already Defined:**
- ErrorTypeNotFound, ErrorTypePermissionDenied, ErrorTypeAlreadyExists
- ErrorTypeValidationFailed, ErrorTypeConnectionFailed, ErrorTypeTimeout
- ErrorTypeResourceExhausted, ErrorTypeInvalidArgument, ErrorTypeInternal

**CommandExecutionResult Structure:**
[Source: docs/architecture.md#components]
```go
type CommandExecutionResult struct {
    Success         bool   `json:"success"`
    Output          string `json:"output"`
    Error           string `json:"error,omitempty"`
    ExitCode        int    `json:"exitCode"`
    ExecutionTime   int    `json:"executionTime"`
    FormattedOutput string `json:"formattedOutput"`
}
```

### Technology Stack
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Backend Language:** Go 1.22+ with comprehensive error handling patterns
- **Framework:** Fiber v3 - Enhanced error middleware and recovery
- **Testing:** Testify 1.9+ for error condition simulation and validation
- **Architecture Patterns:** Circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, graceful degradation

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#error-handling]

**Go Error Handling Best Practices:**
- Always handle errors explicitly, never ignore them
- Use structured error types with context and recovery suggestions
- Implement proper error wrapping with fmt.Errorf and %w verb
- Add comprehensive logging for error scenarios with structured fields
- Create user-friendly error messages that avoid technical jargon

**Service Resilience Patterns:**
- Exponential backoff for transient failures
- Circuit breaker patterns for external service dependencies
- Graceful degradation when downstream services are unavailable
- Health check endpoints for service monitoring
- Proper panic recovery with logging and alerting

### Integration with Existing Systems
[Source: pkg/models/context_entity.go and pkg/nlp/context_resolver.go]

**Context-Aware Error Handling:**
- Leverage existing SessionContext to provide targeted error suggestions
- Use ReferenceItem data to suggest alternative commands when references fail
- Integrate with existing entity extraction to provide resource-specific recovery
- Utilize existing validation patterns for consistent error reporting

**NLP Service Integration:**
- Extend existing TranslatorService with error handling workflows
- Integrate with ContextResolver for reference-specific error suggestions
- Use existing EntityExtractor for resource validation in error scenarios
- Build on established session management for error state tracking

### Security and Error Information
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#security-standards]
- Error messages must not expose sensitive cluster information
- Failed authentication errors should not reveal user existence
- Resource not found errors should respect RBAC permissions
- Error logs must not contain secrets or credentials
- All error handling must respect namespace isolation

### Testing
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

**Testing Standards:**
- **Framework:** Testify 1.9+ for Go testing with mock and assert capabilities
- **Test Location:** Tests co-located with source files (`*_test.go`)
- **Coverage Target:** >80% code coverage for core error handling functionality
- **Testing Approach:** Table-driven tests for various error scenarios

**Specific Testing Requirements for Story 1.5:**
1. **Error Simulation:** Test all defined error types with various kubectl failure modes
2. **Recovery Validation:** Verify suggested recovery actions work correctly
3. **API Resilience:** Test behavior during simulated API outages and network issues
4. **Stress Testing:** Validate error handling under high load and concurrent failures
5. **Integration Testing:** Test end-to-end error workflows across all system components
