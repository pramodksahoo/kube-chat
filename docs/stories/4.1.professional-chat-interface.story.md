## Dev Notes

**Priority:** P0 (Critical) - Foundation for all web interface functionality
**Story Points:** 8
**Dependencies:**
- Epic 2 (Authentication and RBAC) - Complete. Provides JWT authentication and user session management
- Epic 1 (Core NLP functionality) - Complete. Provides backend APIs for command processing
- Epic 3 (Audit and Compliance) - Complete. Provides audit logging integration for user activity tracking

**Previous Story Insights:**
Epic 3 completed with comprehensive audit logging infrastructure including real-time SIEM integration, tamper-proof storage, and compliance evidence generation. The `pkg/audit/` services provide WebSocket integration capabilities and user activity logging that will be essential for frontend audit trail integration.

**Data Models:**
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#technology-stack-table]
- **WebSocket Message Structure:** Real-time chat messages with user identity, timestamps, and message types
- **User Session Context:** JWT-based authentication state with RBAC permissions from Epic 2
- **Conversation History:** Client-side conversation persistence with search and filtering metadata
- **Chat Message Types:** User input, assistant responses, system notifications, command confirmations

**API Specifications:**
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#go-services]
- WebSocket endpoint: `ws://api-gateway/chat` - Real-time bidirectional messaging with JWT authentication
- REST API: `GET /api/v1/conversations` - Retrieve conversation history with pagination
- REST API: `POST /api/v1/conversations/search` - Search conversations with filtering
- Authentication: JWT token validation via WebSocket handshake and API calls

**Component Specifications:**
[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#ui-ux-design-specifications]
- **Chat Layout:** Single-screen interface with contextual slide-out panels
- **Message Components:** Role-based styling (user, assistant, system) with timestamp and status indicators
- **Input Component:** Natural language input field with accessibility features and typing indicators
- **Professional Styling:** Enterprise-appropriate design with safety-first color coding system
- **Responsive Design:** Desktop-first with tablet optimization (768px+ breakpoints)

**File Locations:**
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#react-frontend]
- Frontend application root: `web/` directory with src/, public/, tests/ structure
- Component library: `web/src/components/` for reusable UI components
- Custom hooks: `web/src/hooks/` for WebSocket, authentication, and state management
- State management: `web/src/stores/` using Zustand for lightweight client state
- Styling configuration: `web/src/styles/` for Tailwind CSS and theme customization
- Test files: `web/tests/` for comprehensive testing with Vitest + Testing Library

**Technical Constraints:**
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#development-environment-requirements]
- Frontend must use React 18.2+ with TypeScript 5.4+ for type safety
- Build system must use Vite 5.1+ for fast development and optimized production builds
- State management must use Zustand 4.5+ for lightweight, TypeScript-first state handling
- UI components must use Tailwind CSS 3.4+ + Radix UI 1.0+ for accessibility compliance
- Testing must use Vitest 1.6+ + Testing Library 14+ for modern testing framework

**Security Considerations:**
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#security-standards]
- WebSocket connections must validate JWT tokens and maintain secure session handling
- All user inputs must be sanitized and validated before processing
- Authentication state must integrate with Epic 2 RBAC permissions for secure access control
- Client-side data must never expose sensitive authentication or cluster information
- All API communications must use HTTPS/WSS with proper certificate validation

**Integration Points:**
- WebSocket integration with `cmd/api-gateway/main.go` for real-time messaging
- JWT authentication integration with Epic 2 authentication services
- User activity logging integration with `pkg/audit/` services from Epic 3
- RBAC permission validation integration with Epic 2 permission enforcement middleware
