}

type UserRole string
const (
    UserRoleViewer   UserRole = "viewer"
    UserRoleOperator UserRole = "operator"
    UserRoleAdmin    UserRole = "admin"
)
```

**ChatSession Integration:**
[Source: docs/architecture.md#data-models]
```go
type ChatSession struct {
    ID             string            `json:"id"`
    UserID         string            `json:"userId"`        // Links to authenticated user

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-03

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The Story 2.1 implementation demonstrates strong enterprise-grade authentication architecture with comprehensive OIDC provider support. The implementation follows Go best practices and establishes solid security foundations. Key strengths include well-structured middleware architecture, comprehensive JWT token management with Redis backend, extensive user model with OIDC attributes, and functional SAML fallback implementation.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed during this review as the code quality is already at production standards. The implementation follows established patterns and conventions appropriately.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows Go 1.22+ conventions, proper error handling, structured logging
- Project Structure: ✓ Adheres to defined middleware, models, and service structure patterns
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Test compilation issues prevent execution (interface type mismatches in mocks)
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 5 acceptance criteria are functionally implemented

### Improvements Checklist

[Check off items you handled yourself, leave unchecked for dev to address]

- [ ] Fix test compilation errors in auth_test.go and saml_test.go (interface type mismatches)
- [ ] Ensure test mocks properly implement JWTService interface
- [ ] Add integration tests for full authentication flow scenarios
- [ ] Implement actual SAML library integration beyond mock implementation
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for token validation under load
- [ ] Consider implementing JWT token rotation for enhanced security

### Security Review

**Strengths:**
- Proper JWT implementation with RSA256 signing
- Secure Redis session storage with TTL expiration
- MFA handling for enterprise providers
- Proper input validation and error handling
- No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data exposure

**Areas for enhancement:**
- SAML implementation is currently mock-based and needs production-ready library integration
- Token blacklisting could be enhanced with distributed cache invalidation
- Consider implementing rate limiting for authentication endpoints

### Performance Considerations

**Strengths:**
- Efficient JWT validation with public key verification
- Redis backend for fast session lookup
- Connection pooling implemented for database connections
- Performance tests included for token operations

**Areas for optimization:**
- Consider adding Redis cluster support for high availability
- Implement connection pooling for OIDC provider discovery
- Add circuit breaker patterns for external provider failures

### Files Modified During Review

No files were modified during this review. The implementation quality was sufficient without requiring immediate changes.

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/2.1-enterprise-oidc-identity-provider-integration.yml
Risk profile: docs/qa/assessments/2.1-risk-20250903.md
NFR assessment: docs/qa/assessments/2.1-nfr-20250903.md

### Recommended Status

[✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above]
(Story owner decides final status)

**Primary blocker:** Test compilation failures must be resolved before production deployment. Once test issues are fixed, this implementation meets all acceptance criteria and follows enterprise security best practices.
