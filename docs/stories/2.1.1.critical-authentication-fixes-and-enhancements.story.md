### Previous Story Context
[From Story 2.1 QA Review]
- Authentication middleware architecture is solid with comprehensive OIDC provider support
- JWT token management with Redis backend is well-implemented with proper security
- User model with OIDC attributes follows established patterns
- Core functionality meets all acceptance criteria but has critical production readiness gaps

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

**Testing Requirements:**
- Test Files: `*_test.go` suffix, same package as code under test
- Test Functions: `TestFunctionName` pattern  
- Table-Driven Tests: Use for multiple test cases
- Testify: Use testify/assert and testify/mock for assertions and mocking
- Coverage Target: >80% code coverage for critical business logic

**Go Testing Pattern Example:**
```go
func TestTranslateCommand(t *testing.T) {
    tests := []struct {
        name     string
        input    string
        expected *models.KubernetesCommand
        wantErr  bool
    }{
        {
            name:  "get pods command",
            input: "show me all pods",
            expected: &models.KubernetesCommand{
                GeneratedCommand: "kubectl get pods",
                RiskLevel:       models.RiskLevelSafe,
            },
            wantErr: false,
        },
    }
    
    for _, tt := range tests {
        t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            service := NewTranslatorService()
            result, err := service.TranslateCommand(context.Background(), tt.input)
            
            if tt.wantErr {
                assert.Error(t, err)
                return
            }
            
            assert.NoError(t, err)
            assert.Equal(t, tt.expected.GeneratedCommand, result.GeneratedCommand)
            assert.Equal(t, tt.expected.RiskLevel, result.RiskLevel)
        })
    }
}
```

### Security Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#security-standards]

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- JWT Tokens: Use secure JWT handling practices
- RBAC Integration: Always check Kubernetes RBAC permissions  
- Session Management: Implement secure session handling
- Audit Logging: Log all security-relevant events

**Secrets Management:**
- No Hardcoded Secrets: Never commit secrets to version control
- Environment Variables: Use environment variables for configuration
- External Secrets: Use External Secrets Operator for production
- Minimal Exposure: Only expose secrets to components that need them
