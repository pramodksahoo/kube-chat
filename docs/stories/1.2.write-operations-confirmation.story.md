## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
[From Story 1.1 Dev Agent Record]
- Pattern-based translation using regex proved highly effective (100% accuracy)
- Fiber v3 framework provides excellent HTTP handling with graceful shutdown
- Safety classification system (SAFE/CAUTION/DESTRUCTIVE) foundation already implemented
- Clean architecture with separate translator, models, and service layers established

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture.md#data-models]

**KubernetesCommand Interface Extensions:**
```typescript
interface KubernetesCommand {
  id: string;
  sessionId: string;
  naturalLanguageInput: string;
  generatedCommand: string;
  riskLevel: RiskLevel;  // Now includes CAUTION and DESTRUCTIVE
  resources: KubernetesResource[];
  status: CommandStatus; // Now includes PENDING_APPROVAL
  executedAt?: Date;
  executionResult?: CommandExecutionResult;
  rollbackCommand?: string;
  approvalToken?: string;      // NEW: For confirmation workflow
  approvalExpiresAt?: Date;    // NEW: Auto-cancel timeout
}

enum RiskLevel {
  SAFE = 'safe',        // Read operations (Story 1.1)
  CAUTION = 'caution',  // Write operations (THIS STORY)
  DESTRUCTIVE = 'destructive' // Delete operations (THIS STORY)
}

enum CommandStatus {
  PENDING = 'pending',
  PENDING_APPROVAL = 'pending_approval',  // NEW: Awaiting user confirmation
  APPROVED = 'approved', 
  EXECUTING = 'executing',
  COMPLETED = 'completed',
  FAILED = 'failed',
  CANCELLED = 'cancelled'
}

interface KubernetesResource {
  kind: string;
  name: string;
  namespace?: string;
  action: 'create' | 'read' | 'update' | 'delete';  // Used for risk assessment
}
```

[Source: docs/architecture.md#core-workflows]

**Confirmation Workflow Sequence:**
1. User inputs write command → NLP processes → Returns command + CAUTION/DESTRUCTIVE risk
2. API returns command preview with approval token
3. User confirms → PUT /nlp/confirm/{commandId} → Execute command
4. User cancels → DELETE /nlp/cancel/{commandId} → Cancel command

[Source: docs/architecture.md#components]

**API Endpoints to Implement:**
- **PUT /nlp/confirm/{commandId}** - User approves pending command execution
- **DELETE /nlp/cancel/{commandId}** - User cancels pending command
- **GET /nlp/commands/{commandId}/status** - Check command status

### Technology Stack
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Backend Language:** Go 1.22+
- **Framework:** Fiber v3 - Add PUT/DELETE endpoints for confirmation workflow
- **Testing:** Testify 1.9+ - Table-driven tests for write operation patterns
- **Database:** None required for this story (in-memory command queue acceptable)

### Command Translation Scope
[Source: PRD Epic 1, Story 1.2]

**Target Write Operation Patterns:**
- "create deployment nginx" → `kubectl create deployment nginx --image=nginx` (CAUTION)
- "scale nginx to 5 replicas" → `kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas=5` (CAUTION) 
- "delete pod nginx-123" → `kubectl delete pod nginx-123` (DESTRUCTIVE)
- "update service nginx" → `kubectl patch service nginx --patch=...` (CAUTION)
- "apply manifest.yaml" → `kubectl apply -f manifest.yaml` (CAUTION)

### Testing

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

**Testing Standards:**
- **Framework:** Testify 1.9+ for Go testing
- **Test Location:** Tests co-located with source files (`*_test.go`)
- **Coverage Target:** >80% code coverage for core functionality
- **Testing Approach:** Table-driven tests for write operation accuracy, confirmation workflow scenarios

**Specific Testing Requirements for Story 1.2:**
1. **Write Operation Recognition:** Verify accurate pattern matching for create, delete, update, patch, scale operations
2. **Risk Assessment:** Validate CAUTION vs DESTRUCTIVE classification based on operation type
3. **Confirmation Workflow:** End-to-end tests for approve/cancel flows with timeout handling
4. **Safety Controls:** Verify commands cannot execute without explicit approval
5. **Error Handling:** Test invalid confirmation tokens, expired approvals, and cancellation scenarios
