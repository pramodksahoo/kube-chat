# Story 1.3: Command Execution Results

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** DevOps engineer,  
**I want** to see command execution results in a readable format,  
**so that** I can quickly understand the cluster state

## Acceptance Criteria

1. System SHALL execute approved kubectl commands against the target cluster
2. System SHALL format command output in human-readable format with proper syntax highlighting
3. System SHALL handle kubectl command failures with clear error explanations
4. System SHALL maintain command history within the current session

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Implement Kubectl Command Execution Engine (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create kubectl client wrapper in pkg/clients/kubernetes.go
  - [ ] Implement command execution with proper RBAC enforcement
  - [ ] Add timeout handling for long-running commands
  - [ ] Create comprehensive error handling for kubectl failures

- [ ] Task 2: Build Command Result Processing System (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Design CommandExecutionResult model in pkg/models/kubernetes_command.go
  - [ ] Implement output formatting with syntax highlighting support
  - [ ] Add structured error parsing for common kubectl failures
  - [ ] Create result serialization for API responses

- [ ] Task 3: Extend NLP Service for Command Execution (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Add kubectl execution endpoint POST /nlp/execute/{commandId}
  - [ ] Integrate with confirmation manager for approved commands
  - [ ] Implement session-based command history tracking
  - [ ] Add execution status updates via command status endpoint

- [ ] Task 4: Implement Command History Management (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Extend ChatSession model to include command execution history
  - [ ] Add GET /nlp/sessions/{sessionId}/history endpoint
  - [ ] Implement in-memory history storage with session lifecycle
  - [ ] Create history cleanup on session expiration

- [ ] Task 5: Comprehensive Testing for Command Execution (All AC)
  - [ ] Create unit tests for kubectl client wrapper (90%+ coverage)
  - [ ] Add integration tests for command execution workflow
  - [ ] Test error handling scenarios and timeout conditions
  - [ ] Add end-to-end tests for complete execution flow

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
[From Story 1.2 Dev Agent Record]
- Confirmation workflow system fully implemented with token-based approval
- Command status tracking (PENDING_APPROVAL → APPROVED) established
- Safety classification system (SAFE/CAUTION/DESTRUCTIVE) operational
- API endpoints for confirmation management available
- APPROVED commands ready for execution in this story

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture.md#data-models]

**CommandExecutionResult Interface:**
Based on architecture references, the CommandExecutionResult should include:
```typescript
interface CommandExecutionResult {
  success: boolean;
  output: string;
  error?: string;
  exitCode: number;
  executionTime: number;
  formattedOutput: string; // Human-readable with syntax highlighting
}
```

**KubernetesCommand Interface Extensions:**
```typescript
interface KubernetesCommand {
  id: string;
  sessionId: string;
  naturalLanguageInput: string;
  generatedCommand: string;
  riskLevel: RiskLevel;
  resources: KubernetesResource[];
  status: CommandStatus;
  executedAt?: Date;
  executionResult?: CommandExecutionResult;  // NEW: For this story
  rollbackCommand?: string;
}

enum CommandStatus {
  PENDING = 'pending',
  PENDING_APPROVAL = 'pending_approval',
  APPROVED = 'approved', 
  EXECUTING = 'executing',     // NEW: For this story
  COMPLETED = 'completed',     // NEW: For this story
  FAILED = 'failed',          // NEW: For this story
  CANCELLED = 'cancelled'
}
```

[Source: docs/architecture.md#core-workflows]

**Command Execution Workflow Sequence:**
1. User confirms command → Command status = APPROVED
2. Execute command → Status = EXECUTING 
3. kubectl execution → Capture output/errors
4. Format results → Status = COMPLETED/FAILED
5. Update session history → Return formatted results

**API Endpoints to Implement:**
- **POST /nlp/execute/{commandId}** - Execute approved command
- **GET /nlp/sessions/{sessionId}/history** - Retrieve command history

### File Structure and Locations

**Files to Create/Extend:**
```
pkg/clients/
├── kubernetes.go              # NEW: Kubectl client wrapper
└── kubernetes_test.go         # NEW: Client tests

pkg/models/
├── kubernetes_command.go      # EXTEND: Add CommandExecutionResult

```

### Technology Stack
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Backend Language:** Go 1.22+
- **Framework:** Fiber v3 - Add POST endpoint for command execution
- **Testing:** Testify 1.9+ - Table-driven tests for kubectl operations
- **Kubernetes Client:** Use client-go library for kubectl operations

### Command Execution Scope
[Source: PRD Epic 1, Story 1.3]

**Target Command Execution Capabilities:**
- Execute APPROVED commands from confirmation workflow
- Support all kubectl operations with proper RBAC enforcement
- Handle both successful outputs and error conditions
- Format results for human readability with syntax highlighting
- Maintain execution history within chat sessions

### Security and RBAC Requirements
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#security-standards]
- Always validate user permissions before kubectl execution
- Never execute commands that bypass Kubernetes RBAC
- Log all command executions for audit compliance
- Sanitize command output to prevent information leakage
- Implement proper timeout handling to prevent resource exhaustion

### Testing

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]

**Testing Standards:**
- **Framework:** Testify 1.9+ for Go testing
- **Test Location:** Tests co-located with source files (`*_test.go`)
- **Coverage Target:** >80% code coverage for core functionality
- **Testing Approach:** Table-driven tests for command execution scenarios

**Specific Testing Requirements for Story 1.3:**
1. **Command Execution:** Verify kubectl commands execute correctly against mock cluster
2. **Output Formatting:** Validate human-readable output formatting and syntax highlighting
3. **Error Handling:** Test various kubectl failure scenarios with proper error messages
4. **Session History:** Verify command history is maintained correctly within sessions
5. **RBAC Integration:** Test permission enforcement prevents unauthorized operations
