## Dev Notes
**Priority:** P0 (Critical) - Required for compliance and security audit trails
**Story Points:** 5
**Dependencies:**
- Story 2.1 (OIDC Integration) - Complete. JWT service available in `pkg/middleware/jwt.go#JWTService` with session tracking capabilities
- Story 2.1.2 (JWT RBAC Claims) - Required for enhanced session context with Kubernetes user identity
- Epic 3 (Audit Framework) - Parallel development for audit integration. Will use structured audit logs from `pkg/audit/session_audit.go`

**Compliance Impact:** HIGH - Required for SOC 2, HIPAA, regulatory compliance

**JWT Session Context (from Stories 2.1 & 2.1.2):**
```go
// Session tracking fields in JWT claims
type JWTClaims struct {
    SessionID           string    `json:"session_id"`        // Required for session lifecycle tracking
    UserID              string    `json:"user_id"`           // User identity for audit correlation
    KubernetesUser      string    `json:"kubernetes_user"`   // K8s identity for command association
    IssuedAt            time.Time `json:"iat"`              // Session creation timestamp
    ExpiresAt           time.Time `json:"exp"`              // Session expiration for timeout policies
}
```

**Integration Points:**
- JWT session management via `pkg/middleware/jwt.go#JWTService.BlacklistToken()`
- Session storage in Redis using existing `pkg/middleware/jwt.go#sessionKey()` patterns
- Session lifecycle hooks for audit logging integration

**Technical Notes:**
- Extends existing JWT service from Story 2.1 with enhanced session lifecycle management
- Must integrate with Redis for distributed session state using existing connection pool
- Audit logs must be tamper-proof and structured, building on Epic 3 audit framework
- Session management must handle high concurrency using existing thread-safe patterns from Epic 1

**Definition of Ready:**
- [x] Acceptance criteria validated with compliance requirements
- [x] JWT service integration approach confirmed
- [x] Redis session storage strategy approved  
- [x] Audit log format aligned with Epic 3 standards
