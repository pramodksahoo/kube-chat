## Dev Notes
**Priority:** P1 (High) - Essential for production usability and user experience
**Story Points:** 3
**Dependencies:**
- Story 2.2 (RBAC Validation) - Complete for error detection via `pkg/middleware/rbac_validator.go#ValidatePermission()`
- Story 2.1.2 (JWT RBAC Claims) - Complete for user context. JWT claims provide permission context for error guidance
- Story 2.1 (OIDC Integration) - Complete for user identity context via `pkg/middleware/jwt.go#JWTClaims`

**User Experience Impact:** HIGH - Critical for user adoption and support efficiency

**RBAC Error Context (from Story 2.2):**
```go
// RBAC validation errors from Story 2.2
type RBACValidationError struct {
    Code           string    `json:"code"`           // RBAC_PERMISSION_DENIED, NAMESPACE_ACCESS_DENIED
    Resource       string    `json:"resource"`       // pods, deployments, etc.
    Verb           string    `json:"verb"`          // get, list, create, delete
    Namespace      string    `json:"namespace"`      // target namespace
    ClusterScoped  bool      `json:"cluster_scoped"` // cluster-level operation
    UserContext    *JWTClaims `json:"user_context"`  // User's current permissions
}
```

**JWT Permission Context (from Story 2.1.2):**
```go
// Available in JWT claims for error guidance
type JWTClaims struct {
    KubernetesUser      string   `json:"kubernetes_user"`    // For permission suggestions
    KubernetesGroups    []string `json:"kubernetes_groups"`  // Current user groups
    AllowedNamespaces   []string `json:"allowed_namespaces"` // Accessible namespaces
    ClusterAccess       bool     `json:"cluster_access"`     // Cluster permissions
}
```

**Integration Points:**
- RBAC error detection via Story 2.2 `pkg/middleware/rbac_validator.go#ValidatePermission()`
- Existing error handling patterns from Epic 1 `pkg/models/error_response.go#ErrorParser`
- Permission suggestion engine building on Epic 1 suggestion patterns

**Technical Notes:**
- Must integrate seamlessly with existing error handling from Epic 1 using established `ErrorParser` patterns
- Error messages should be security-conscious (don't reveal sensitive cluster info beyond user's permissions)
- Must support multiple output formats (CLI, API, web interface preparation) using existing response structures
- Should cache permission suggestions to reduce Kubernetes API load, leveraging Story 2.2 permission caching

**Definition of Ready:**
- [ ] Error message templates reviewed for clarity and security
- [ ] Integration approach with existing error handling confirmed
- [ ] RBAC suggestion logic validated with security team
- [ ] User experience flow approved by product team
