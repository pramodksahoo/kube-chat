## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
[From Story 1.3 Dev Agent Record]
- Session management foundation implemented with ChatSession model and lifecycle management
- Command history tracking already established in pkg/models/chat_session.go
- NLP Service has session manager with command tracking capabilities
- Execution results are stored and can be referenced for context extraction

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture.md#data-models]

**ChatSession Interface Extensions:**
Based on architecture references, the ChatSession should be extended to include:
```typescript
interface ChatSession {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  clusterContext: string;
  namespace: string;
  messages: ChatMessage[];
  status: SessionStatus;
  createdAt: Date;
  lastActivity: Date;
  expiresAt: Date;
  contextData?: SessionContext;  // NEW: For this story
}

interface SessionContext {
  lastCommandOutput: KubernetesResource[];
  namedEntities: ContextEntity[];
  referenceableItems: ReferenceItem[];
  contextExpiry: Date;
}

interface ContextEntity {
  type: string;
  name: string;
  namespace?: string;
  position: number; // For numbered references
  lastSeen: Date;
}
```

[Source: docs/architecture.md#components]

**NLP Service Extensions:**
The NLP service needs context resolution capabilities:
- Context extraction from kubectl command outputs
- Reference resolution for follow-up commands
- Context validation and expiration handling

**API Endpoints to Implement:**
- **GET /nlp/sessions/{sessionId}/context** - Retrieve current context
- **DELETE /nlp/sessions/{sessionId}/context** - Reset session context
- **POST /nlp/sessions/{sessionId}/validate-reference** - Validate context references
