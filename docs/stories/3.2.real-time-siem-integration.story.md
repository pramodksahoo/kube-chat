### Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

**Priority 1 (MUST FIX):**
1. **Implement JWT Token Validation** (`pkg/audit/export/auth.go`)
   - Complete the `ValidateSessionToken` function
   - Add proper JWT parsing, signature verification, and claims validation
   - Integrate with existing authentication infrastructure

2. **Add Missing API Endpoints** (`cmd/audit-service/main.go`)
   - Implement SIEM export API endpoints (`/api/v1/audit/export`)
   - Add streaming configuration endpoints (`/api/v1/audit/stream/*`)
   - Wire export service to HTTP handlers with authentication middleware

3. **Security Audit Required**
   - Complete security review of all authentication flows
   - Verify RBAC integration for export operations
   - Validate input sanitization across all endpoints

**Priority 2 (Should Address):**
1. Add rate limiting to prevent abuse of export APIs
2. Implement audit logging for all SIEM operations
3. Add monitoring and alerting for SIEM integration health

### Technical Debt Identified

- Authentication framework partially implemented but not integrated
- Export service has comprehensive logic but no HTTP interface
- Some test failures in validation scenarios (non-blocking)
- Configuration templates extensive but not fully tested end-to-end

### Security Review

**CRITICAL SECURITY VULNERABILITY IDENTIFIED**: Authentication bypass allows unauthorized access to audit data export. This represents a severe compliance and security risk for enterprise deployments.

**Additional Security Findings:**
- Proper HMAC implementation for webhook authentication
- TLS configuration options present
- Input validation present in format converters
- No hardcoded secrets identified

### Performance Considerations

Architecture demonstrates good performance design patterns:
- Concurrent webhook delivery
- Streaming with proper buffering
- Database query optimization with pagination
- Memory-efficient large dataset handling

### Files Modified During Review

**None** - Critical issues require development team resolution before any QA modifications.

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/3.2-real-time-siem-integration.yml

**Reason**: Critical authentication vulnerability and missing API endpoints prevent production deployment. Core acceptance criteria AC3 not accessible via HTTP interface.

### Recommended Status

❌ **Changes Required** - Critical security and integration issues must be resolved before story completion.

**Required Actions:**
1. Implement complete JWT token validation
2. Add HTTP API endpoints for SIEM export functionality  
3. Integrate authentication middleware with all SIEM endpoints
4. Complete end-to-end API testing with authentication flows
5. Security audit and penetration testing of authentication mechanisms
