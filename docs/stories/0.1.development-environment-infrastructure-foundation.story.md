## Dev Notes

### Critical Infrastructure Gap Analysis
**Current State**: Stories 1.1-4.5 were implemented without proper development infrastructure:
- DEV AI agents worked in isolation without following documented setup procedures
- No integration testing or air-gap validation was performed
- Missing all deployment automation and configuration management
- No comprehensive development workflow following Phase 1 Model 1 requirements

### Previous Story Integration Issues
From Stories 1.1-4.5 analysis:
- **Story 1.1**: NLP service implemented without Helm deployment or air-gap testing
- **Story 2.1**: Authentication service lacks development deployment configuration
- **Story 3.1**: Audit service missing PostgreSQL integration in development environment
- **Story 4.1**: Web interface lacks Docker builds and Helm chart integration
- **All Stories**: No reference to development setup procedures or air-gap validation
