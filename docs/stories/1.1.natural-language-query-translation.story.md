### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture.md#components]

The NLP Processing Service is a dedicated Go microservice responsible for translating natural language requests into kubectl commands with safety analysis and risk assessment.

### Technology Stack
[Source: docs/architecture.md#tech-stack]
- **Backend Language:** Go 1.22+
- **Backend Framework:** Fiber v3 (3.0+) - High-performance web framework, faster than Gin
- **AI/ML Runtime:** Ollama 0.1.26+ for local LLM inference (privacy-first)
- **Fallback API:** OpenAI API integration with circuit breaker pattern
- **Testing:** Testify 1.9+ (Industry standard Go testing framework)

### Data Models
[Source: docs/architecture.md#data-models]

**KubernetesCommand Interface:**
```typescript
interface KubernetesCommand {
  id: string;
  sessionId: string;
  naturalLanguageInput: string;
  generatedCommand: string;
  riskLevel: RiskLevel;  // For this story: SAFE (read operations)
  resources: KubernetesResource[];
  status: CommandStatus;
  executedAt?: Date;
  executionResult?: CommandExecutionResult;
  rollbackCommand?: string;
}

enum RiskLevel {
  SAFE = 'safe',        // Read operations (THIS STORY)
  CAUTION = 'caution',  // Write operations
  DESTRUCTIVE = 'destructive' // Delete operations
}

enum CommandStatus {
  PENDING = 'pending',
  APPROVED = 'approved', 
  EXECUTING = 'executing',
  COMPLETED = 'completed',
  FAILED = 'failed',
  CANCELLED = 'cancelled'
}
```

### API Specifications
[Source: docs/architecture.md#components]

**Key Interfaces to Implement:**
- **POST /nlp/process** - Natural language to kubectl translation
- **POST /nlp/validate** - Command safety assessment and risk level determination (for future stories)

### Command Translation Scope

**Target Natural Language Patterns (for 90%+ accuracy):**
- "show me all pods" → `kubectl get pods`
- "list pods in namespace default" → `kubectl get pods -n default`
- "describe service nginx" → `kubectl describe service nginx`
- "get deployments" → `kubectl get deployments`
- "show nodes" → `kubectl get nodes`
- "describe pod [pod-name]" → `kubectl describe pod [pod-name]`
- "list namespaces" → `kubectl get namespaces`

### Previous Story Context
No previous stories exist - this is the foundational story for Epic 1.

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: docs/architecture.md#tech-stack]

- **Framework:** Testify 1.9+ for Go testing
