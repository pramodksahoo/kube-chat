## Dev Notes
**Priority:** P0 (Critical) - This is the most important security story for Epic 2
**Story Points:** 8
**Dependencies:** 
- Epic 1 (NLP Foundation) - Complete. Requires integration with command translation flow from `pkg/nlp/translator.go#TranslateCommand()` and error handling patterns from `pkg/models/error_response.go#ErrorParser`
- Story 2.1 (OIDC Integration) - Complete for basic JWT foundation
- **Story 2.1.2 (JWT RBAC Claims)** - REQUIRED for enhanced Kubernetes context in JWT tokens
**Security Impact:** HIGH - This story prevents unauthorized command execution

**JWT Token Context (from Stories 2.1 & 2.1.2):**
```go
// Enhanced JWT claims structure for RBAC integration
type JWTClaims struct {
    UserID              string    `json:"user_id"`           // Required for RBAC subject identification
    Email               string    `json:"email"`             // User identifier for audit logs
    KubernetesUser      string    `json:"kubernetes_user"`   // K8s user for SelfSubjectAccessReview
    KubernetesGroups    []string  `json:"kubernetes_groups"` // K8s groups for RBAC mapping
    AllowedNamespaces   []string  `json:"allowed_namespaces"` // Pre-validated namespace access
    ClusterAccess       bool      `json:"cluster_access"`    // Cluster-level permissions flag
    SessionID           string    `json:"session_id"`        // Required for session-based caching
}
```

**Integration Points:**
- JWT validation via `pkg/middleware/jwt.go#ValidateToken()` 
- Enhanced claims provide Kubernetes context without additional API calls
- Session-based permission caching using SessionID from JWT

**Technical Notes:**
- Must integrate with Kubernetes client-go RBAC APIs using `SelfSubjectAccessReview`
- Enhanced JWT claims from Story 2.1.2 provide essential Kubernetes context
- Performance is critical - RBAC checks happen on every command (<100ms target)
- Must handle edge cases: cluster-admin users, service accounts, impersonation
- Permission caching strategy essential for scale (Redis-backed with TTL)

**Architecture Integration:**
**Source:** `docs/architecture.md#security-standards`
- RBAC integration with Kubernetes client-go APIs using `SelfSubjectAccessReview`
- Performance requirements: <100ms validation target for all permission checks
- Security model: Never escalate permissions beyond user's Kubernetes role
- Circuit breaker patterns for Kubernetes API unavailability

**Source:** `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#middleware-patterns`  
- Follow established middleware patterns for validation hooks and request interception
- Use structured logging with logr for all permission decisions and audit trails
- Implement error boundary patterns for robust authentication and authorization flows
- Build on thread-safe concurrent operations patterns from Epic 1 implementation

**Definition of Ready:**
- [ ] Acceptance criteria reviewed and approved by security team
- [ ] Dependencies confirmed available (Epic 1 complete, Story 2.1.2 JWT enhancements ready)
- [ ] Kubernetes RBAC integration approach validated with client-go library
- [ ] Security review completed for permission validation logic and bypass prevention
- [ ] Performance targets confirmed (<100ms per RBAC validation)
- [ ] JWT claims structure from Story 2.1.2 approved for RBAC context

## Testing
**Test Strategy:** Security-focused testing with multiple RBAC configurations

- ServiceAccount token permission checking  
- Permission caching behavior and invalidation
- Kubernetes API unavailability handling

**Security Tests:**
- Attempt to bypass RBAC validation
- Permission escalation attack scenarios
- Cross-namespace access prevention
