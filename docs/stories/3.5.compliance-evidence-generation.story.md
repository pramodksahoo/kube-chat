## Dev Notes

**Priority:** P1 (High) - Required for regulatory audit response and compliance evidence management
**Story Points:** 5
**Dependencies:**
- Story 3.1 (Comprehensive User Activity Logging) - Complete. Provides audit data foundation via `pkg/audit/storage.go`
- Story 3.3 (Audit Trail Search and Investigation) - Complete. Provides search and compliance query capabilities
- Story 3.4 (Tamper-Proof Audit Storage) - Complete. Provides integrity verification and cryptographic evidence foundation

**Previous Story Insights:**
Story 3.4 established comprehensive tamper-proof audit infrastructure with cryptographic integrity verification. The existing `pkg/audit/integrity.go` includes `IntegrityService` with compliance reporting capabilities (SOC 2, HIPAA) that provides the foundation for evidence generation. The `ComplianceReport` and verification methods are already available for evidence package creation.

**Data Models:**
[Source: pkg/models/audit_event.go - existing codebase]
- **Audit Event Structure:** Complete audit event model with cryptographic checksums and integrity verification
- **Integrity Verification:** Existing integrity verification methods and compliance reporting infrastructure
- **Evidence Metadata:** Chain of custody and verification certificate data structures needed
- **Package Structure:** Evidence package format with multi-format export capabilities

**API Specifications:**
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#go-services]
- POST /api/v1/audit/evidence/generate - Generate compliance evidence packages for specific periods
- GET /api/v1/audit/evidence/packages - List all generated evidence packages with metadata
- GET /api/v1/audit/evidence/download/:id - Secure download of evidence packages with access logging
- GET /api/v1/audit/evidence/verify/:id - Verify integrity of generated evidence packages

**Component Specifications:**
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#file-organization-principles]
- **Evidence Service:** `pkg/audit/evidence.go` - New evidence generation and packaging service
- **Template Engine:** `pkg/audit/templates/` - Compliance framework templates for SOC 2, HIPAA, ISO 27001
- **Storage Integration:** `pkg/audit/storage.go` - Existing storage interface for audit data retrieval
- **API Integration:** `cmd/audit-service/main.go` - Existing audit service enhanced with evidence endpoints

**File Locations:**
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#go-services]
- Evidence generation service under `pkg/audit/evidence.go` following established patterns
- Compliance templates in `pkg/audit/templates/` directory for framework-specific formatting
- HTTP handlers in existing `cmd/audit-service/main.go` extended with evidence endpoints
- Test files co-located as `*_test.go` following Go conventions
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/audit_evidence_integration_test.go`

**Technical Constraints:**
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#security-standards]
- All evidence packages must include cryptographic integrity verification from Story 3.4
- Evidence generation must not impact audit data ingestion performance
- Evidence downloads must be logged and tracked for chain of custody compliance
- Evidence packages must support configurable retention and secure deletion

**Security Considerations:**
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#security-standards]
- Evidence access must enforce RBAC permissions from Epic 2 authentication framework
- Chain of custody tracking must be tamper-proof and cryptographically verifiable
- Evidence package signing must use same cryptographic standards as audit data (SHA-256)
- Evidence downloads must be audited and logged in the main audit trail

**Integration Points:**
- Existing `pkg/audit/integrity.go` provides compliance reporting foundation for evidence generation
- `pkg/audit/storage.go` provides audit data retrieval interface for evidence package creation
- `pkg/models/user.go` provides user context for RBAC-scoped evidence generation
- Authentication middleware from Epic 2 for secure evidence generation and download operations
