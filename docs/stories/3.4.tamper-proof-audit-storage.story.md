## Dev Notes

**Priority:** P0 (Critical) - Required for legal compliance and regulatory audit validity
**Story Points:** 5
**Dependencies:**
- Story 3.1 (Comprehensive User Activity Logging) - Complete. Provides audit storage foundation via `pkg/audit/storage.go`
- Story 3.2 (Real-Time SIEM Integration) - Complete. Establishes audit data streaming architecture
- Story 3.3 (Audit Trail Search and Investigation) - Complete. Provides search infrastructure for integrity verification

**Previous Story Insights:**
Stories 3.1-3.3 established comprehensive audit infrastructure with PostgreSQL-based storage, real-time SIEM integration, and advanced search capabilities. The existing `pkg/models/audit_event.go` already includes SHA-256 capability, providing foundation for cryptographic integrity implementation.

**Data Models:**
[Source: pkg/models/audit_event.go - existing codebase]
- **Cryptographic Foundation:** Existing SHA-256 import and hash capability in audit_event.go
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 16+ with CloudNativePG operator for tamper-proof audit storage
- **Storage Patterns:** Append-only audit logs with cryptographic integrity verification
- **Encryption:** AES-256 for audit data at rest with External Secrets Operator integration

**API Specifications:**
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#go-services]
- POST /api/v1/audit/integrity/verify - Integrity verification for audit record ranges
- GET /api/v1/audit/integrity/report - Generate integrity verification reports for compliance
- GET /api/v1/audit/integrity/status - Real-time integrity monitoring status
- POST /api/v1/audit/integrity/repair - Detect and report integrity violations

**Component Specifications:**
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#file-organization-principles]
- **Entry Point:** `cmd/audit-service/main.go` - Existing audit service to be enhanced with tamper-proof capabilities
- **Integrity Engine:** `pkg/audit/integrity.go` - New cryptographic integrity verification service
- **Storage Enhancement:** `pkg/audit/storage.go` - Existing storage to be enhanced with immutable patterns
- **Model Enhancement:** `pkg/models/audit_event.go` - Existing model to be enhanced with cryptographic checksums

**File Locations:**
[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#go-services]

- Integration tests in `tests/integration/audit_integrity_integration_test.go`

**Technical Constraints:**
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#security-standards]
- All cryptographic operations must use industry-standard algorithms (SHA-256, AES-256)
- Integrity verification must not impact audit data ingestion performance
- Encryption keys must be managed through External Secrets Operator
- Database migrations must preserve existing audit data integrity

**Security Considerations:**
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#security-standards]
- Cryptographic keys must never be logged or exposed in error messages
- Integrity verification operations must enforce RBAC permissions from Epic 2
- At-rest encryption must be transparent to authorized users with proper permissions
- Hash chain verification must detect any sequence tampering or missing records

**Integration Points:**
- Existing `pkg/audit/storage.go` provides the audit data storage interface foundation
- `pkg/models/user.go` provides user context for RBAC-scoped integrity verification
- Authentication middleware from Epic 2 for secure integrity verification operations
- External Secrets Operator integration for encryption key management
